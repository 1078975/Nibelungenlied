            </epigraph>
            <p rend="h_2">But at last the Burgundians became weary of the sickening
               <lb/>conflict, and they sought to have a parley with
               <lb/>Etzel, to the intent that they might have his permission to
               <lb/>depart out of his land.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the heart of the kind old man had become embittered
               <lb/>within him by the cruel slaughter of his child, and his answer
               <lb/>was—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“My child and my friends ye have killed, and would ye have
               <lb/>peace with me now? While my heart beats I will make no peace
               <lb/>with you, dastardly slayers of babes as ye are.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And yet once again the Burgundians offered to lay down
               <lb/>their arms, so that they might escape with their lives; and then
               <lb/>Criemhild, hearing of the conference that was going on between
               <lb/>her husband and brothers, rushed wildly into the hall, where
            <pb n="65"/>
            
               <lb/>they were holding parley. Her golden hair hung dishevelled
               <lb/>upon her shoulders, and a fire as of madness glittered in her eye.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Would ye have peace? Would ye have peace?” cried she,
               <lb/>in a voice of such shrill and piercing agony that it vibrated
               <lb/>through every corner of the vaulted hall. “Ye shall have peace,
               <lb/>ye shall have leave to depart, but it shall be only upon one
               <lb/>condition. We are children of one mother, therefore get you gone;
               <lb/>but leave Hagen, the foul murderer, a hostage in my hands.”
               <lb/>Then the three princes looked darkly one at another, and
               <lb/>Gernot made answer:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Royal sister, that cannot be. Never shall it be said that
               <lb/>a Burgundian, to purchase his own safety, gave up one of his
               <lb/>friends into the hands of a foeman.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Your blood then be upon your own heads,” cried the queen;
               <lb/>and she and Etzel left the chamber, while the three princes
               <lb/>returned back to their comrades, and the red slaughter began
               <lb/>again.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But a frenzy, as of madness, possessed Criemhild; her
               <lb/>enemy should not escape, even though her own life should be
               <lb/>the penalty; so she called her husband's liegemen, and bade them
               <lb/>set fire to the great hall in which the Huns and Burgundians
               <lb/>were fighting.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Horrible and more horrible became the scene; and, before
               <lb/>the morning dawned, many a mother's son, who had managed
               <lb/>to escape the sword of the enemy, fell to earth, a prey to the
               <lb/>devouring flames.</p>
            <pb n="66"/>
            
            <p rend="h_2">Now the margrave, Rudiger,
               <lb/>having had Gunther's permis
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>sion to do so, had left the hall
               <lb/>immediately after Ortleben's
               <lb/>slaughter, at the same time
               <lb/>that Dietrich of Berne had led
               <lb/>out the king and queen, for his
               <lb/>soul revolted from the cruel
               <lb/>carnage, and he thought foul
               <lb/>scorn that a brave man should
               <lb/>take revenge upon an innocent
               <lb/>babe; but when he heard how
               <lb/>the queen had taken vengeance
               <lb/>upon her foes, he felt heavy
               <lb/>and sad at heart, and it was no
               <lb/>shame to his manhood that the
               <pb n="67"/>
            
               <lb/>big tears dropped from his eyes, as the wail of the dying came
               <lb/>borne to him on the morning breeze.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And as he thus stood weeping before the burning hall, a Hun
               <lb/>pointed him out to Criemhild as being but a chicken-hearted
               <lb/>knight, though clad in a coat of mail, else would he have fought
               <lb/>good blows in the queen's quarrel.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then Rudiger, stung to the quick at hearing these words,
               <lb/>doubled his fist, and rushing upon his slanderer, struck him such
               <lb/>a mighty blow that he fell dead to the ground.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The dead man had not known that the margrave had been
               <lb/>the envoy sent by Etzel to invite the Burgundian princes to his
               <lb/>court, and that he was, moreover, father-in-law to Geiselher,
               <lb/>having given his fair daughter to him to wife; and for both
               <lb/>these reasons the brave, good man had besought Gunther that
               <lb/>he might be allowed to keep well out of the contest.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But now as he stood in the presence of the king and queen,
               <lb/>Criemhild besought him, by the oath of allegiance that he had
               <lb/>sworn to her husband and herself, that he would take up his
               <lb/>sword and strike yet another blow in her cause. Then Rudiger
               <lb/>besought the king to absolve him from his oath, and let him
               <lb/>depart an exile from the land, rather than lay such a burden
               <lb/>upon him, as to bid him stretch forth his hand against the
               <lb/>men whom he had welcomed as friends under his own roof-
               <lb/>tree.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But no! Death, death to the last. Revenge upon Hagen
               <lb/>and his allies was the one wish of Etzel and the queen.</p>
            <pb n="68"/>
            
            <p rend="h_2">They threw themselves at Rudiger's feet, imploring him to
               <lb/>strike but once again and rid them of their enemies.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">So Rudiger had no choice but to go forth and throw
               <lb/>himself into the deadly struggle.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And as he entered the vaulted chamber where the Nibelungen
               <lb/>princes, and such of their knights as had escaped from the fiery
               <lb/>death were assembled, he bade them take back the troth he had
               <lb/>once pledged to them; for though sorely against his will, yet for
               <lb/>the sake of the oath he had sworn to Etzel, he must needs fight
               <lb/>against them even to the death.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And the three princes answered him with courteous words,
               <lb/>for they saw the trouble of his soul, and they knew that in such a
               <lb/>case a brave man could have no choice.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">So they stood ready to begin again the deadly struggle.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But Hagen cried out: “Wait awhile, my lords, for I am
               <lb/>in a great strait; the Huns have cleft my shield to pieces,
               <lb/>and I know not how I shall protect myself in this new conflict
               <lb/>without it.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then the noble Rudiger cried out: “Here is mine, take
               <lb/>that, and God be praised that it is mine to give thee.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Now when the Nibelungen princes and knights heard the
               <lb/>generous words of Rudiger, rough men as they were, the salt
               <lb/>tears washed their grimy cheeks; and even Hagen vowed that
               <lb/>the earth could never bring forth a nobler rival than he, and that
               <lb/>however the affair might go on, his hand at least should never
               <lb/>touch him.</p>
            <pb n="69"/>
            
            <p rend="h_2">After that the struggle began in right earnest. Like a warhorse
               <lb/>scenting the battle, Rudiger threw himself wildly into the
               <lb/>combat; with flashing sword he cut a pathway through the Burgundians,
               <lb/>and Gernot and he at last closed in mortal conflict.
               <lb/>Conquerors and conquered, each fell by the hand of the other.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And soon the sad news spread to the Winter Palace, and
               <lb/>Etzel and Criemhild, with the Huns who were with them, heard
               <lb/>that the brave Rudiger was slain.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Now Dietrich of Berne was sorely grieved for the death of
               <lb/>his noble friend, so summoning his band of trusty followers, he
               <lb/>rushed to the place of combat, determined at once and for ever to
               <lb/>put an end to the contest, and to avenge his loss.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And this at last he did; for though the Burgundians fought
               <lb/>like wild panthers at bay, they were now too few to resist.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">One after another they were stricken down, till only Hagen
               <lb/>and Gunther remained; and the former, too, was so sorely
               <lb/>wounded, that Dietrich considered that it was little glory to kill
               <lb/>him then, whereas he would be a rare prize to carry captive to
               <lb/>the queen, so he let his shield fall to the ground, and throwing
               <lb/>his arms round his weakened opponent, carried him into Criemhild's
               <lb/>presence, while Gunther, who was also wounded followed
               <lb/>in sullen despair.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">With feverish joy Criemhild greeted Dietrich as she beheld
               <lb/>him bringing her foe captive to her feet, telling him that now
               <lb/>indeed he had brought her balm to relieve her woe.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And the noble Dietrich replied: “Great queen, grant him
               <pb n="70"/>
            
               <lb/>but his life, it may be that he will render you such good service
               <lb/>as may atone for all the grief he has caused you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then Criemhild had Hagen carried to a dungeon, where he
               <lb/>was guarded with bolts and bars, and then she turned to Gunther.
               <lb/>Alas I that a thirst for revenge should have warped Criemhild's
               <lb/>once tender heart. She forgot that Gunther and she were children
               <lb/>of one mother,—forgot everything but that he had been the friend
               <lb/>and ally of her foe Hagen.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">With bitter irony in her voice, she bade him welcome, and
               <lb/>the king answered:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Noble sister, it were indeed both duty and pleasure to
               <lb/>thank you for your greeting, had it been offered in sincerity; but
               <lb/>I know your mood, O queen, and that it is but in mockery you
               <lb/>thus salute me.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then Dietrich of Berne spoke:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Royal lady, never have mine eyes beheld so noble a hostage
               <lb/>as I give into your hands; but remember, gracious queen, that he
               <lb/>is an exile from his Father-land, and for my sake treat him well.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And Criemhild answered:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He shall indeed be treated well according to his merit.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Slowly and sadly Dietrich went out of the queen's presence;
               <lb/>brave knight as he was he wept for the two soldiers whom
               <lb/>though conquered by his own prowess he yet pitied as men who
               <lb/>were doomed to die far from home and native land.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then Criemhild took the vengeance for which she had so
               <lb/>thirsted.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">She caused her servants to put Gunther in safe durance, and
               <lb/>she herself went to Hagen to hold parley with him.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And she told him that if he would give back to her the
               <lb/>treasures of which he had despoiled her, she would ensure that
               <lb/>he and Gunther should be conveyed back in safety to their
               <lb/>own land.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the reply of the sullen Hagen was only this:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You do but waste your words upon me, O queen I I
               <lb/>have sworn that so long as one of your brothers, my royal
               <lb/>lieges, remains upon earth, so long shall the hoard never be
               <lb/>given up.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And the queen answered:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“So let it be;” and went straightway from Hagen's presence,
               <lb/>and caused her servants to go at once to Gunther's prison
               <lb/>chamber and cut off his head.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then seizing it by the long hair which betokened his royal
               <lb/>lineage, she re-entered Hagen's dungeon. Her eye glittering
               <lb/>with the light of madness, and holding the ghastly thing before
               <lb/>him, she bade him at once reveal where the Nibelungen hoard
               <lb/>lay hid, for fate had now absolved him from his oath.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Then the once all-powerful Hagen, trembling with impotent
               <lb/>rage, but with unabated pride, cried out:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“That indeed thou shalt never learn, devil's wife as thou
               <lb/>art. None but heaven and myself know the spot where it lies,
               <lb/>and sooner should my tongue be torn from my mouth, than that
               <lb/>thou shouldst wrest my secret from me.”</p>
            <pb n="72"/>
            
            <p rend="h_2">And the queen cried out in
               <lb/>answer:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Base deceiver, yet shalt thou not strip me of all. The
               <lb/>sword that my Siegfried wore,
               <lb/>when he left me for the fatal
               <lb/>hunt, I will have whether thou
               <lb/>wilt give it me or not.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">So saying, with a sudden
               <lb/>rush towards him, she drew it
               <lb/>from the scabbard, and Hagen,
               <lb/>sorely wounded as he was, had
               <lb/>no power to resist.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Brandishing the weapon
               <lb/>with both hands, Criemhild
               <pb n="73"/>
            
               <lb/>aimed a blow at Hagen. A good aim in truth it was, for his
               <lb/>gory head fell at her feet, and Siegfried's murder was avenged.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the men who stood by uttered an angry wail, for shame
               <lb/>to think that a soldier should fall thus stricken by a weak
               <lb/>woman's hand.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And Hildebrand, one of the servants of Dietrich, cried out:—</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Now, though I die for it, I will avenge the Trongian
            Hagen.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And forthwith he sprang towards Criemhild, and with his
               <lb/>dagger struck her to the heart.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">And so ends the story; kings and warriors, and fair queen,
               <lb/>all cut down in the bloom of their beauty and their strength, to
               <lb/>accomplish the law of an inexorable fate.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Criemhild had plucked the deadly blossom of revenge, but
               <lb/>its poisonous juices had shrivelled up the hand that grasped it,
               <lb/>and the noxious odour from its fœtid berries had impregnated the
               <lb/>air with a wide-spread miasma of death and desolation.</p>

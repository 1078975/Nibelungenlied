            <head rend="allcaps center">The After Word.</head>
            <p rend="h_2">Such is the story of Siegfried (or Sigurd), as we
               <lb/>gather it from various. German and Scandinavian
               <lb/>legends. In this recital I have made no attempt to
               <lb/>follow any one of the numerous originals, but have
               <lb/>selected here and there such incidents as best suited
               <lb/>my purpose in constructing one connected story which
               <lb/>would convey to your minds some notion of the beauty
               <lb/>and richness of our ancient myths. In doing this, I
               <lb/>have drawn, now from the Volsunga Saga, now from the
               <lb/>Nibelungen Lied, now from one of the Eddas, and now
               <lb/>from some of the minor legends relating to the great
               <lb/>hero of the North. These ancient stories, although
               <lb/>differing widely in particulars, have a certain general
               <lb/>relationship and agreement which proves beyond doubt
               <lb/>a common origin. “The primeval myth,” says Thomas
               <lb/>Carlyle, “whether it were at first philosophical truth, or
               <pb n="292"/>
               <lb/>historical incident, floats too vaguely on the breath of
               <lb/>men: each has the privilege of inventing, and the far
               <lb/>wider privilege of borrowing and new modelling from
               <lb/>all that preceded him. Thus, though tradition may
               <lb/>have but one root, it grows, like a banian, into a whole
               <lb/>overarching labyrinth of trees.”
            </p>
            <p rend="h_2">If you would follow the tradition of Siegfried to the
               <lb/>end; if you would learn how, after the great Hoard had
               <lb/>been buried in the Rhine, the curse of the dwarf
               <lb/>Andvari still followed those who had possessed it, and
               <lb/>how Kriemhild wreaked a terrible vengeance upon Sieg
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>fried's murderers,—you must read the original story
               <lb/>as related in the Volsung Myth or in the Nibelungen
               <lb/>Song. Our story ends with Siegfried.
            </p>
            <p rend="h_2">The episodes which I have inserted here and there—the
               <lb/>stories of Ægir, and of Balder, and of Idun, and of
               <lb/>Thor—do not, as you may know, belong properly to
               <lb/>the legend of Siegfried; but I have thrown them in,
               <lb/>in order to acquaint you with some of the most beau
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>tiful mythical conceptions of our ancestors.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">A grand old people were those early kinsmen of ours,
               <lb/>—not at all so savage and inhuman as our histories
               <lb/>would sometimes make us believe. For however mis
               <lb rend="hyphenBefore" break="no"/>taken their notions may have been, and however
               <pb n="293"/>
               <lb/>ignorant they were, according to our ideas of things,
               <lb/>they were strong-hearted, brave workers; and, so far
               <lb/>as opportunity was afforded them, they acted well their
               <lb/>parts. What their notions were of true manhood,—a
               <lb/>strong mind in a strong body, good, brave, and handsome,
               <lb/>—may be learned from the story of Siegfried.

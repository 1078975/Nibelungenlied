            <p rend="h_2">Siegfried was now deſirous to try the ſharpneſs
               <lb/>of his ſword, and it glided through the Dragon's
               <lb/>ſhield like water and went deep into the rock.
               <lb/>All were full of joy when they ſaw this; but the
               <lb/>wiſe Dwarf alone looked grave and ſaid, “Thou haſt a harder
               <lb/>battle ſtill to fight, and thou requireſt meat and drink to refreſh
               <lb/>thee for it.” Then he blew his little ſilver horn, and at its
               <lb/>thrill found there came forth from the crevices of the rocks
               <lb/>Dwarfs, white and grey. Then they ſpread a carpet and brought
               <lb/>meat and drink of all kinds, and Siegfried ſat down and ate, and
               <lb/>the maiden offered him a golden drinking-horn, ſaying, “Hail
               <lb/>to the hero of the Netherlands! hail to the bold ſon of Sieg
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>mund! hail to the fighter with the Dragon, Siegfried!” The
               <lb/>hero drained the cup and ſaid, “Truly never did I feel ſo in
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>ſpired with courage, and never longed for the chaſe of the boar
               <lb/>in my father's foreſts as I now do for the conteſt with this
               <lb/>hideous Dragon, the keeper of the treaſure of the Nibelungen.
               <lb/>If my forefathers ſtood here in a circle, as they ſtand around the
               <lb/>walls of our halls at home, they would indeed rejoice in the
               <lb/>conteſt for the ſound of my ſword ſhall re-echo far around, and
               <pb n="107" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1078975/Nibelungenlied/main/Heroic_life/Heroic_life_107.png"/>
             
               <lb/>gladden the heart of many a hero. Come what may, I dread
               <lb/>none on earth, and I ſtand here on this ſtone, armed and pre
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>pared with this uplifted ſword to meet the fight.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">As he ſpoke thus a roaring ſound was heard, which vibrated
               <lb/>nearer and nearer, as if the mountain were ſhaken and falling
               <lb/>into ruins. Thereupon the maiden was ſtruck with great
               <lb/>terror; but the eyes of Siegfried glanced like two flaming
               <lb/>ſwords, and he bade her be of good cheer, ſaying, “The Author
               <lb/>of Light gave us life, and how ſhall the Dragon of darkneſs
               <lb/>take it away? my ſharp and gleaming ſword ſhall dazzle him
               <lb/>ſo that he ſhall not be able to diſtinguish the day from the
               <lb/>night.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">As the evening twilight aroſe, the Dragon came ſlowly
               <lb/>onwards, hovering like a dark ſtorm-cloud. Siegfried ad
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>vanced and met him on the edge of the rock. Near him
               <lb/>ſtood his two faithful dogs. The maiden drew back, and the
               <lb/>Dwarf put on his cap of miſt and crept into a crevice of the
               <lb/>rock. Three times did the Dragon fly ſearching around the
               <lb/>ſtone, for as yet he had not ſeen the hero. But juſt as he was
               <lb/>about to lie down he perceived Siegfried, and ſending forth
               <lb/>furiouſly blue flames, he laſhed the earth with his tail. In a
               <lb/>moment the hero's ſhield was covered with blue flame, and became
               <lb/>glowing hot; his dogs were about to fly at the monſter,
               <lb/>but they fell dead to the earth at his firſt breath. The poiſonous
               <lb/>flames darted more and more fearfully on Siegfried; and to cool
               <lb/>himſelf he was forced to withdraw into the vaulted gallery of
               <pb n="108" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1078975/Nibelungenlied/main/Heroic_life/Heroic_life_108.png"/>
            
               <lb/>the mountain. Thither the Dragon could not follow him, for
               <lb/>the paſſage was too narrow; ſo he remained ſpouting forth
               <lb/>fire at the entrance, and knew not how to get in; nor did
               <lb/>Siegfried know how he ſhould reach the Dragon with his good
               <lb/>ſword. In this difficulty he looked around and ſaw lying near
               <lb/>him a huge ſtone, which ten men could not have lifted.
               <lb/>Remembering his great anceſtors, he ſeized it, and threw it in
               <lb/>the gaping throat of the peſtiferous monster; and now the
               <lb/>flames being quenched, he darted with ſword and ſhield upon
               <lb/>the Dragon, and dealt him blow after blow upon the head.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the blows of Siegfried's ſword at firſt produced no
               <lb/>effect, the ſcales were hard as diamonds, and the ſword flew
               <lb/>back. On a ſudden, as he was ſtriking with all his might, he
               <lb/>heard a plaintive tone, which ſeemed like the voice of the
               <lb/>Dwarf, as if calling for help from the Dragon's jaws. And ſo
               <lb/>it was; for the Dwarf had ſeated himſelf, under his inviſible
               <lb/>cap of mill, upon the ſtone which Siegfried had thrown into
               <lb/>the Dragon's mouth, and he now called out in terror leſt Sieg
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>fried ſhould kill him.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">When the Dragon heard the cry of the inviſible Dwarf he
               <lb/>turned round; but at that moment Siegfried dealt him a heavy
               <lb/>blow on his neck, at the point where the ſcales were a little
               <lb/>parted. The ſword ſtruck into the neck, and the pent-up
               <lb/>flames burſt through the wound at the ſide, ſo that Siegfried
               <lb/>was now ſafe from them. The little Dwarf crept quickly
               <lb/>out of the wound. The Dragon raved ſtill more with the
               <pb n="108a" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1078975/Nibelungenlied/main/Heroic_life/Heroic_life_108a.png"/>

               <lb/>pain; he fell on Siegfried, ſnatched his ſhield, and ſnapping
               <lb/>it like a lath he flew at the hero's head. But Siegfried
               <lb/>too was now fired with rage, and graſping his ſword firmly
               <lb/>ſtruck off the monſter's right claw. Thereupon the Dragon
               <lb/>roared with fury, ſwung his tail around, and ſtrove to entwine
               <lb/>the hero in its folds. But Siegfried at a bound leaped high
               <lb/>above the tail, and now ran with ſuch force againſt the monſter
               <lb/>that he threw him backward on the ground; then ſeizing his
               <lb/>ſword with both hands, with the firſt blow he drove it two
               <lb/>ſpans deep into his breaſt, at the ſecond he cut his heart through
               <lb/>and through, ſo that the ſword ſank deep into the ſtone; and
               <lb/>as he was about to give a third blow, he himſelf fell ſenſeleſs
               <lb/>beſide the monſter, which in the death-ſtruggle was conſumed
               <lb/>in its own fire.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Such was the great fight with the black, poiſonous Dragon,
               <lb/>who guarded the treaſure of the ancient curſe, by which the
               <lb/>hero of the Low Countries acquired fame and glory above that
               <lb/>of all his fathers. The deeds he wrought with his ſharp ſword
               <lb/>at the Drachenſtein have reſounded for centuries from north to
               <lb/>ſouth in many an heroic lay by the ancient minſtrels; nor can
               <lb/>the name of Siegfried the Dragon-ſlayer ever paſs away as long
               <lb/>as German ſong is ſung.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Pale as death lay the exhauſted hero for a long time; then
               <lb/>he fetched a deep breath, and ſlowly opened his eyes. But
               <lb/>how great was his ſorrow when he ſaw lying near him the
               <lb/>King's daughter, pale and motionleſs as a corpſe. He ſprang
               <pb n="110" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1078975/Nibelungenlied/main/Heroic_life/Heroic_life_110.png"/>
            
               <lb/>up, took her in his arms, called on her by name; but ſhe awoke
               <lb/>not, nor gave any ſigns of life. The hero began to lament
               <lb/>aloud his misfortune, when at length Euglein the Dwarf came
               <lb/>ſtealing by. He looked about on all ſides, and was overjoyed
               <lb/>when he ſaw that Siegfried had ſlain the Dragon. He imme
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>diately went to the virgin, took a root from his girdle, and with
               <lb/>its ſcent awoke her to new life. The joy of Siegfried was only
               <lb/>equalled by that of the beautiful daughter of the Rhine King ;
               <lb/>and Euglein too was ſo delighted at their deliverance from the
               <lb/>Dragon, that he begged the hero to claim from him what
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>ever he liked, gold or diamonds, coſtly ornaments or weapons,
               <lb/>for all were at his command. Siegfried thanked him for his
               <lb/>offer, but ſaid that his deliverance of the maiden was reward
               <lb/>enough for him; if however he deſired to do him a favour,
               <lb/>he would aik him, who was ſo well informed of the future, to
               <lb/>tell him his deſtiny. The Dwarf immediately placed his
               <lb/>bright gleaming ſhield on a table of ſtone, and held a handful
               <lb/>of dry graſs to the ſun, which forthwith burſt into a flame:
               <lb/>then he ſtrewed a precious perfume over the ſhield. A ſin
               <lb break="no" rend="hyphenBefore"/>gular odour diffuſed itſelf around, but the Dwarf inhaled the
               <lb/>vapour, his eyes cloſed, and turning a coſtly ring on his finger,
               <lb/>began, as if in a deep ſlumber, to pronounce the following
               <lb/>invocation:—

            <p rend="h_2">Thus ſang the Dwarf of the fate of future days. Siegfried
               <lb/>and the maiden were deeply affected by the ſerious tone of his
               <lb/>ſong. Although they had not underſtood all that he ſaid, yet
               <lb/>they perceived that bleeding forms looked through the miſt
               <lb/>that ſurrounded the whole, and that theſe were lighted rather
               <lb/>by fierce and fatal lightning than by the gentle rays of ſunſhine
               <lb/>and peace. When the Dwarf had ended, he took his leave,
               <lb/>ſaying that he muſt deſcend deep into the mountain, whither
               <lb/>his Dwarfs had fled, anxious for the reſult of the conteſt: for
               <lb/>he would bring them the glad intelligence of victory. Then
               <lb/>he bade the hero farewell, and promiſed, if he ſhould require
               <lb/>his aid, to aſſiſt him with all his power and all his wealth;
               <lb/>adding, that he would find two horſes ready for mounting at
               <lb/>the mouth of the cave. Siegfried thanked him, and the Dwarf
               <lb/>diſappeared in a crevice of the rock.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The hero and the King's daughter reſted for awhile on
               <lb/>the ſummit of the Drachenſtein, and looked at the far diſtance,
               <lb/>over the lofty wooded tops of the mountains, over the green
               <lb/>plains and vales, the barren heaths and ſilver ſtreams. Then
               <lb/>they examined everything in the cave, and came to the Dragon's
               <lb/>couch, which he had made of the ſkins of lions. Siegfried
               <lb/>lifted up the ſkins, and a dazzling light burſt upon his ſight,
               <lb/>and the treaſure and the ring lay before him. But he forgot
               <lb/>the warning voice of the Dwarf, concerning the ancient curſe
               <lb/>which lay on the gold of the Nibelungen: he took the treaſure
               <lb/>of diſcord and envy, and hence at a later period the words of
               <pb n="117" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1078975/Nibelungenlied/main/Heroic_life/Heroic_life_117.png"/>
            
               <lb/>Euglein came to be fulfilled, and he and his whole race were
               <lb/>annihilated by fire and ſword, like thoſe who had poſſeſſed it
               <lb/>before. The treaſure however was caſt into the Rhine, where
               <lb/>it may reſt until a holy hand ſhall find it, over which the curſe
               <lb/>has no power.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Here, however, ends this tradition: and its ſequel has
               <lb/>been ſaid and ſung in other ſongs and legends, in which, reader,
               <lb/>thou mayeſt hear how Siegfried celebrated in the Roſe-garden
               <lb/>of Worms his marriage with Chriemhilda, how he gloriouſly
               <lb/>contended in ſeven conflicts, winning heroic fame, and how he
               <lb/>was ſlain in the foreſt by the cruel Hagen at the inſtigation of
               <lb/>Brunhilda, but was fatally avenged by Chriemhilda on the
               <lb/>Giants, their brothers and relations.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the good town of Worms, where Siegfried celebrated
               <lb/>his marriage and where he was treacherouſly ſlain, honoured his
               <lb/>memory by a praiſeworthy cuſtom for centuries after, out of
               <lb/>gratitude for its deliverance from the cruel Dragon. When a
               <lb/>minſtrel ſang his deeds publicly before all the people in ſuch
               <lb/>a manner that the judges appointed could find no fault, a piece
               <lb/>of gold was awarded him by the council of the city. In our
               <lb/>poor times this ancient cuſtom no longer exiſts; but in former
               <lb/>days, the city cauſed the figures of Siegfried and the ancient
               <lb/>race of kings to be painted in different places, at the council-
               <lb/>houſe, at the Mainz-gate, at the new tower, and at the mint,
               <lb/>where the bones of the Dragon hung in chains of iron. Siegfried's
               <lb/>ſpear was preſerved, and the Roſe-garden is ſtill ſhown;

               <lb/>and when, in 1488, the Emperor Frederick the Third was at
               <lb/>Worms, he ordered the bones of the hero to be fought for in
               <lb/>the churchyard, but nothing was diſcovered. Certain it is
               <lb/>however, that up to the preſent day the armorial bearing of
               <lb/>Worms is the Giant's key which locked up the ſtone, and the
               <lb/>ſupporter the fiery Dragon whom Siegfried ſlew, and that his
               <lb/>memory lives in the ſongs of many a minſtrel and in the hearts
               <lb/>of the people.</p>
